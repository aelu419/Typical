      How was it?

      ...Listening...

      (As
      if I actually care about the reply)

      Well ok, I''m the narrator

      I''m
      officially outside the game now

      As free as I could be!

      I''m thinking
      of writing my own story someday

      Not gonna wait for somebody else to
      feed it to me

      But the weather isn''t quite as lovely as...

      ...
      well, as what I expect to be ...

      ... on that hypothetical day that I
      start writing

      So let''s just put the task off as of now :)'
