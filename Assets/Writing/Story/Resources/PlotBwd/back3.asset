    exactly happens? <O stump/> Like, sure, some flyable thing comes out of it eventually,
    but would that be you? Would it think like you, or feel like you?\u201D <O stump/>\r\n\u2026
    \u2026\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve heard <B>stories</B>, my friend. <O stump/> Some say
    you\u2019ll fall asleep and another mind takes over. You\u2019ll know <O npc
    hostile/> how to fly the instant you get <O npc hostile/> out, but are you--the
    worm you--born with that knowledge? Or did anyone teach you to fly? <O stump/>
    The only explanation is: this other spirit who is born with flight knowledge
    takes over. <O npc hostile/> You\u2019re just <B>dead</B>.\u201D\r\n"
