  text: "Ha\u2026 I actually kinda forgot how it went\u2026 <H>wrote it and rewrote
    it so many times and now I can\u2019t get a hold of it\u2026</H>\r\nOh, yeah,
    right, it starts at afternoon\u2026 alright:\r\nIt was a summer afternoon. Rain
    clouds were gathering on the distant horizon, but they weren\u2019t tinted pink
    yet, not with the sun up high. <O npc random/>\r\nThere was a <B>silkworm<B>
    knitting itself a cocoon. The worm was absolutely <I>filled</I> with chewed leaves,
    almost to the brink of bursting--the early months of its life were just endless
    binge-eating, afterall. \u201CNow it\u2019s time to put it all to use, I guess,\u201D
    it told itself.\r\nIt dragged the silk to the left, stuck it in place, fixed
    it steady, and started over to the right--then up, and down, and left again.
    <O npc random/>\r\nThere was something of a frame already in place, but it looked
    nothing like a cocoon.\r\nThe worm had been working on it for <I>hours</I>, and
    the initial excitement for starting something life changing (literally) was starting
    to wear off.\r\nIt felt all the chewed leaves tumbling in its stomach, making
    it <I>nauseated</I>, and the summer heat didn\u2019t help at all--the sun was
    like an overseer, not a motivator\u2026 and the repetitive work adds a layer
    of hypnosis on top of the nausea.\r\nAs the worm drilled the routine into its
    subconscious: <I>left, right, up, down</I>, it began to lose sight over what\u2019s
    around it, shifting instead to a sort of \u201Cautopilot\u201D.\r\n"
