  text: "I wonder if someone will steal it if it stays outside the door like this.
    It\u2019s been days and it\u2019s still standing there.\r\nBut again, everyone\u2019s
    shut in nowadays, I guess the thieves have <B>hygiene</B> as well.\r\nShould
    I let it in? <H>Does it even know how to get in?</H>\r\nI guess I\u2019ll just
    wait some more, then. <O npc random/>\r\nWell, okay, not just waiting, I can
    do some practice. Let\u2019s see\u2026 there\u2019s this pronunciation thing
    I learned back then, I think I still remember it:\r\nOnce upon a time, there
    was a young rat named Arthur who couldn\u2019t make up his mind.\r\nWhenever
    the other rats asked him if he would go out with them, he would say, \u201CI
    don\u2019t know.\u201D\r\nAnd when they said, \u201CWould you rather stay inside?\u201D\r\nHe
    wouldn\u2019t say yes or no either. He never wanted to make a choice. <H>Hmm\u2026
    this reads awfully like what we\u2019re in right now\u2026 </H>\r\nOne fine day,
    his aunt appealed to him\u2026 <O npc random/>\r\n<H>Did it make a noise? I think
    I heard something, some metallic sound. Let me check outside\u2026</H>\r\nHuh\u2026
    the thing\u2019s moving\u2026? I can\u2019t tell what gesture it\u2019s doing--it
    looks like it\u2019s\u2026 happy? Excited? Agitated? I remember they said it\u2019ll
    give me feedback--is this what they were talking about?\r\n"
