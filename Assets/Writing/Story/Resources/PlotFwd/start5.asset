  text: "Yesterday was so weird. Why would the thing start moving all of a sudden?\r\nDid
    it hear what I was saying?\r\n<H>But shouldn\u2019t it only react to the actual
    script of the story?</H> And when I went back to practicing, I think I heard
    it kept moving as I spoke. <O npc random/>\r\nLet me try again\u2026 I think
    this is where I stopped yesterday:\r\nThe old rat caught sight of young Arthur,
    who wasn\u2019t in the line, and wasn\u2019t exactly outside it. He stood just
    nearby, hesitating. \u201CYou are coming too, aren\u2019t you?\u201D Asked the
    old rat. \u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D said Arthur calmly, \u201CI\u2019m not
    certain, the roof may not fall down yet.\u201D \u2026\r\nHere it is again! That
    sound! And it\u2019s moving again, how perfectly un-strange! Damn it, why\u2026
    what\u2026 why? Does it not care about what I say? <O npc random/>\r\nIt\u2019s
    almost deadline right, or is it deadline already? Is it returning to The Company?\r\nBut
    I haven\u2019t even started yet! \r\nOh, I know what to do, I\u2019ve got this
    PERFECT story I\u2019ve been wanting to tell all this time, and since they\u2019re
    not gonna give me the script, I\u2019ll just go ahead with <I>that instead!</I>\r\nIf
    they\u2019re gonna troll me, I should troll them back!"
