  text: "The rain was quite boring, occasional drops broke into the unfinished cocoon,
    and then just left\u2026\r\nThe path was mostly washed off, and so the worm never
    got to meet the rest of the \u201Cordinary, hardworking insects\u201D.\r\nA bird--feathers
    damped and heavy--approached the cocoon, took some chances poking at it, but
    couldn\u2019t get the worm out. <O npc random/>\r\nSuddenly, a non-sense <B>idea</B>
    flashed across its water-weighed head, and was immediately approved by its decisional
    facility out of pure boredom.\r\n\u201CWill you please come out,\u201D asked
    the bird, completely un-serious.\r\nThe worm had no idea how to react, but thanks
    to an \u201Cequal but opposite\u201D boredom, it decided to reply: \u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,
    you see, what you\u2019re trying to do in this cocoon, I can help you do it faster,
    and better.\u201D\r\n\u201CWait what? You\u2019re gonna finish building this
    by\u2026 <I>letting me come out?</I> That makes no sense at all.\u201D\r\n\u201CSee,
    after you finish building, do you know what exactly happens? Like, sure, some
    <B>flyable thing</B> comes out of it eventually, but would that be <B>you</B>?
    Would it <B>think</B> like you, or <B>feel</B> like you?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell,
    who else could it be?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve heard stories, my friend. Some
    say you\u2019ll fall asleep and <B>another mind</B> takes over. You\u2019ll know
    how to fly the instant you get out, but are you--the worm you--born with that
    knowledge? Or did anyone teach you to fly? The only explanation is: this other
    spirit, who is born with flight knowledge, replaces yourself. You\u2019re just
    dead.\u201D <O npc random/>\r\n\u201CUhh\u2026 okay\u2026? Still no reason to
    get <I>out</I>, though.\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, if you come out now, you\u2019ll
    soon become <B>part of a flying creature</B>, aka <I>myself</I>: no tiring work
    wiggling for days, no insomnia, no slow, lonely death. And besides, this <I>alternative<I>
    flying creature gets to last way longer than some random moth you\u2019ll get
    to be. Basically: better product, better experience, better efficiency!\u201D\r"
