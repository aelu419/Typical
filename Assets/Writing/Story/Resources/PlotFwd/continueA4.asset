  text: "What next? I think that's where I left off last time I rewrote of this thing.\r\n<H>I
    think I had a version where the worm met some grown moth or butterfly, but then
    the lifecycle thing would make no sense: how can they coexist at the same time?\r\nOh
    God... what do I say next... should've made a draft before this...\r\nWould those
    people hear it? I mean, I think it's only gonna record the relevant lines, so
    my rambling wouldn't be up...\r\nOr not, it goes back and some poor inspector-director-guy
    will waste minutes listening to bullshit on birds talking to worms. </H>\r\nWait,
    isn't my original goal to troll them? Then it's better to let them hear!\r\nBut
    it feels weird that my rambling is heard by... anyone else... feels almost <I>unethical</I>.
    <O npc random/>\r\nI mean, I guess it's their fault for trolling with me. Let's
    just ramble on... \r\n"
