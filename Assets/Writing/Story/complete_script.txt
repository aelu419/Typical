Oh hey there, little robot!
You got my script? ...
<H>Does it even understand words..?</H>
Um, do you have the script, for me, from the Company?
<H>This really isn't working isn't it... talking to a robotic trash bin...</H>
I said, do <I>you</I>, have, the <I>script</I>, for <I>me</I>, from the <I>Company</I>? ... ...
I guess not, then...
Oh wait, wait a second, let me look for it, ..., here it is: <O img letter1/> do you recognize this?
Look at the seal, do you tell?
They sent me this weeks ago, told me I got a narrator role for some weird typing game.
Do you recognize the <I>T</I> here? ... ...
<O lamp/>
<H>Can't believe I'm doing this...
why would I think this trash bin's got fancy <B>image recognition</B>...</H>
Ah, well... guess I'll have to wait for the script for another day

[part2]

[part3]

Why is it still there?
Is the battery out?
--it's still making noise, though, and that light inside it...
Was there a glitch in it somewhere?
Some navigation problem or whatever...
<O lamp/>
What even is going on, first that letter, then this... <I>helmet-can-machine-thing</>,
what do they want from me?
Can it see, or hear?
Are Company folks just peeking at my dumb face through some camera?
<H>It's all a trick isn't it, just to see me make myself a goof...
I think I wasn't even qualified, they're just trolling me with this.</H>
Let me read the letter again, just to see if I misread anything
<H>Maybe it wasn't addressed to me at all!</H>

Dear ..., Congratulations! You have been accepted as a narrator

Congratulations on noticing the back side.
Statistically, you are already in the second quartile for our company's narrators, some of whom don't even notice this section.
As one of the 23 narrators of this game, you will try your best at narrating the <B>entire</B> script, and we will decide which portion of it get mixed into the final product.
You will receive payment based on how high that portion is.
<O lamp/>
Note that although your performance will not be included in its entirety, you must finish the <B>entire</B> script with <B>decent quality</B> in order to be <B>considered</B>.
To ensure the diversity of our sampling, you must not communicate with other narrators until you receive our final evaluations,
which you must not disclose to each other.
Along with the script, you will also meet our company's automated audience device, which will provide real-time feedback to your performance.
Submission of any recording (i.e. any intelligible utterance during the stay of our automated audience) means that you agree with the terms and conditions...

How have I not thought of this before!
Device and script, device AND script, they're in the same thing!
Sorry for calling you a <I>trash bin</I>, little thing, no matter you heard me saying it or not.
Oh god, I must start at once!
First page, let me see, wait I'm holding it up side down...
First page, first part, ah here it is... part one:
