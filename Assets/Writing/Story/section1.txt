Oh <I>hello</I> there! See, we're still figuring things out--it's been <I>days</I> and they still haven't sent me the script yet. They told me there's gonna be a great story. "Players are gonna love it," they say. 
Look at this letter they've sent me <O img letter1/>--fancy as hell, even got seals on it... And then? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!
Anyway, I'm the narrator, or perhaps "scribe" would be a more accurate word for it. <H>Coming to think of it, I <I>could</I> just write my own stuff and add decorations <O img decoration1/> whenever I like to. Huh... </H> But that's not why I'm here--I'm here to give you a <I>Story</I>, like the good one they haven't sent us yet.
Well I guess we should just keep waiting for a while, maybe they'll finally remember about this in a day or two. Maybe I was stretching about how long the wait is, maybe it's just a few days, or a few hours, minutes even--I'm "the narrator" afterall, not <I>"the clock"</I>--telling time isn't what I'm for. Let's try to be optimistic, maybe the delivery's been delayed for a short while and that's it. Maybe we can start everything in the next chapter. See you until then!
